# Genomics-Project

In this project we are using machine learning to classify 801 RNA-Seq gene expression samples to predict whether a particular sample is likely to be one of the five cancers namely Breast cancer(BRCA), Renal Cancer(KIRC), Colon Cancer (COAD), Lung Cancer(LUAD) and Prostate Cancer(PRAD). The samples are composed of 20,531 genes.To reduce the dimensionality and get optimal features we used principal component analysis(PCA). 
For classification we have used random forest, naive-bayes, light gradient boosting machine(LGBM).
